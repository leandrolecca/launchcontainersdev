# This yaml file is to config launchcontainer, by inputing the correct infomation, you will be able to launch the corresponding container on your local or cluster
#
# This file should be copied from garikoitz/launchcontainer/example_configs 
# You may want to put it to your working directory ~/PROJECT/nifti
# It will work with a subsesList.txt file and other container specific config files

########################

# General description:
# There are three categories of config information for you to set up this soft: 
# general settings, 
# container specific settings, 
# and computing host settings(we call it host options).

  # basedir:  
      # type: str
      # description: Path to the folder of your project where you put the dicom and nifti folders. 
      # author note: 
      #   1. Remember to give the full path of the directory starting from /, do not use ~
      #   2. If you are using public folders, go from generic public wihout using your path e.g. useing /bcbl/public instead of using /export/xxxx/public
  # containerdir:
      # type: str
      # description: Path to where all the singularity images are stored. For Docker, this can be empty 
  # container:
      # type: str
      # description: Name of the container you want to launch, version and other details will needs to be input in container_options
      # auther note: 
      #   1. the valid options are listed below, be sure not to input wrong name
  # analysis:
      # type: str or int
      # description: The name of your analysis, e.g. 01, 001, abcd, etc. It will help you create a corresponding folder under derivetives/container
  # force:
      # type: bool / don't sensitive to capital letters True and true both okay
      # description: Options whether you want to overwritte the existing file or not
      # author note: 
      #   1.This force command applies to symlinks and analyses, if it set to true, it will always overwrite everything
      #   2.For PREPARE MODE
      #     if file_exists and force: overwrite
      #     if file_exists and not force: do nothing and print(say that the file existed but you kept it)
      #     if not file_exists: we don't care about force, you add the file (the symlink)
  # host
      # type: str
      # description: where you want to run the program, valid options: local, BCBL, DIPC.
